This folder contains various media campaigns for countering the fear raised by news in regards to the tech layoffs
in late 2022, and early 2023. The campaigns included a visualization dashboard, a blog post, an executive presentation,
a video presentation, and an infographic. The project was created under a disguise of working for a hiring company.
Since the tech layoffs scared people from applying, we were losing a lot of business sending batches of workers
to different companiesl. Each media camaping was responsible in spreading the message to a different audience.
The visualization dashboard created on PowerBI and the executive presentation was to present to the executive board
a reason to go around and advertise our hiring company. The infographic, the blog post, and the video presentation
were used as a way to lure the general audience in to applying for data science jobs in particular. Data science is an
up and coming field and people with technical backgrounds who have been laid off may benefit from changing careers
to data science as it requires similar skills sets to software engineering and other tech jobs. The variety in
visualizations, the overall color schemes, and the writing style helps convey the message in these different campaigns.

The notebook file reveals a bit about how I decided on different visualizations before creating and adding them to
the various news campaigns. The PowerBI file is also provided if you would like to try out the visualizations there,
although I would recommend having the right dataset for it first.
