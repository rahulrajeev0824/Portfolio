This project was more of a passion project as I am currently working as a high school tutor. I wanted to figure out what factors best determine student success. While the project was based on universities in Brazil, I find that we can translate a lot of the educational structures into the ones fed into the model. Most of the factors to success lie in being able to have your credits approved and completed. 

Loading Data:
The student success csv is provided in the directory, a simple .read_csv should do the trick

Implementation:
The visualizations and modeling are all built on the csv so feel free to mess around with the visualizations the model
parameters to see whether better results can be achievable, or if you come to a different conclusion!
