The first actual data science experience. Given a dataset and a message to send, I found trends in the MLB data that will increase the attendance per game. Without much surprise, the star factor was the bobblehead giveaway. 
Surprisingly baseball fans will attend day or night regardless of weather and who the opponent is to get those sweet, limited merch. 

Loading Data:
The dodgers.csv file is provided above.
Just use pandas to read the file as a csv.

Implementation:
The visualizations and modeling are all built on the csv so feel free to mess around with the visualizations the model
parameters to see whether better results can be achievable, or if you come to a different conclusion!
