Welcome to my data science portfolio repository! I will be presenting ten projects I created during my master's degree that I believe showcase my skills as a data scientist.

1)	Weather Forecast
a)	Forecast app that uses a weather API to tell the users what the weather is based on their location.
2)	Potentially Hazardous Asteroids
a)	A astronomy project that included early data analysis, CDFs, PDFs, overall view of statistics, and a preliminary binary logistic regression model to predict whether an asteroid is potentially hazardous.
3)	Nonorganic Views in KPOP
a)	Exploring what attributes of a KPOP music video would require the use of view botting: director, composition of the artist (solo vs. group; boy vs. girl), active fanbase, etc. An overview of early data analysis and visualizations
4)	Movie Rating Predictive Analysis
a)	Can we predict the rating of a movie based on its attributes: director, genre, length, rating, writers, etc. Used MLR (multi-linear regression) and data engineering to accomplish the task.
5)	MLB Attendance
a)	Given a dataset and a message to send, what trends in the MLB data demonstrate an increase or decrease in attendance?  
6)	Student Success
a)	Figure out what factors best determine student success: credits, economic background, age, gender?
7)	Layoff Visualizations
a)	A public announcement recognizing the availability of data science in different forms such as a blog, a video, a dashboard, and an infographic. The combination of these can reach any audience.
8)	Restaurant Recommendation
a)	Recommendation systems that uses both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to recommend restaurants to users.
9)	Garbage Image Classification
a)	A study of convolutional neural networks on the classification of garbage images. First use of AI enhancing for background removal.
10)	TBA
a)	Haven't decided on the final project yet

Any additional projects will be added on throughout my professional career as well, so stay tuned for those!
