The universe is incredibly old, big, and still expanding with mass. Who isn’t to say that extra-terrestrial life exists? Enrico Fermi summarized with this paradoxical question, “If aliens did exist, how come they haven’t contacted us yet?”. The statement changed the way people and researchers alike thought about aliens. While I believe that the Fermi Paradox holds its own weight, I still think that extraterrestrial life exists outside of our common knowledge and the way that they keep tabs on Earth is through these UFO sightings. Most sightings have been disproven by the public or by the government claiming that the ships seen were all their testing property. However, now that I have the tools to do so, I can take a deeper look at what makes UFO sightings so unique. Are the visits seasonal or are they monthly? What are the most common descriptions of UFO sightings and the mechanisms of the ships? This project will take a dive into a subset of UFO sightings and will attempt to find patterns.

This project delves into natural language processing and time-series analysis.

Implementation:
The jupyter notebook walks through the EDA and visualizations. The text generation model can be altered and the string data can be further formatted to avoid abbreviations and random words not in the English dictionary.
The time-series can be extended with additional information in regards to the hyperparameters of ARIMA models, or studying new grouping of the data to find trends in grouping by season, day, and hour.
