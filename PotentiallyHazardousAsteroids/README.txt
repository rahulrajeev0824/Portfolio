This was a Jupyter notebook file that consisted of many statistical concepts. 
I want to share this in the portfolio to show my understanding these concepts. 
It included early data analysis, CDFs, PDFs, overall view of statistics, and a preliminary binary logistic regression model to top it all off. 
The topic was very astrophysics friendly, so the overall project was a lot of fun. 
This was my first project mixing my astrophysics background with data science concepts so Iâ€™m looking forward to completing more.
The file utilizes functions from a specific library in the ThinkStats textbook, so the code would need to be adjusted
to use more opensource libraries. Regardless, the statistical exploration is the highlight.
