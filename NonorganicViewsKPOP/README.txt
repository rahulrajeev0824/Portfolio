While the topic seems quite nuanced, I found that nonorganic views were a legit thing for KPOP (Korean pop) music. 
Instantly I thought it would be a great idea to explore what attributes of a KPOP music video would require the use of view botting. 
I found a lot of interesting trends including botting percentages depending on director, composition of the artist (solo vs. group; boy vs. girl) 
and whether there exists an active fanbase.

Loading data:
1. Included is the final_videos4 which was a merged data collection of the original four csvs from the kaggle link
2. The api dataframe created by collecting data from the Youtube API 
3. The website dataframe created by webscraping off of a website that reports nonorganic views of Kpop videos

Implementation:
You can skip the transformations sections in the code and create visualizations based on the three csvs or 
perform the webscraping, api calling, and merging yourself to get a unique dataframe. The choice is yours.
